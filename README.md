Starting tests following the research on: https://www.notion.so/Ethernet-API-1a6ed9807d5880b18a6ad3ddcd8840b4 

Right now, cargo build --bin blinky --release should work

To do: 
  - check memory.x file with datasheet
  - adapt the eth example code to work on this microcontroller
  - start writing the P2P UDP code
